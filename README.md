# Account_Contact_Manager
This requirement implements a salesforce solution to manage and track the number of Contacts by Contact Type for each Account. 
Features:

a)Custom button (Contact type) on Account record to trigger a LWC 
b)LWC displays a table of unique Contact Types based on Type and State for the selected Account.
c)Multiple contact types can be selected.
d)Creates or updates a custom object for unique combinations of Account, Type, and State.
e)Enforces validation rules to ensure the number of Contacts per combination does not exceed 5.
f)User-friendly error messages for validation failures.
g)Uses a mix of declarative tools (Flow) and custom code (Apex and Lightning Web Components) for future flexibility.


             Working functionality scenario using a code-based approach
             

1. Created a Data model to link the account to a custom object (Contact type)

2. Created new quick action button (contact type) on Account object

3. Created dummy data which consists of the unique combination of Type & State

4. Click on the button Contact Type, display the Type, State and # of contacts with the row selectable option

5. Click on the process selected, display success validation for further processing where it checks if a unique combination exists, updates the number of contacts else creates a record

5. In this case, the new record & existing record are updated, and for the first time, the record is created & for existing contact the contact count is updated in the new custom object Contact_Type__c

6. If the number of contacts exceeds 5, then display user user-friendly error message

7. If none of the rows is selected & clicked on the process selected, display the user-friendly error msg

               Partially developed using a declarative tool (Flow) & highlighting the challenges below.
   
 1. Fetcing the unique combination of Type & State for the contacts
      <img width="956" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3125ead9-6086-4e92-a213-1f41c41df2a2">
      Issue:
      I)Multiple loops, decision elements, assignments which slow down the performance in the long run if it has a large dataset of records
      II) Debugging complexity -> With multiple loops & decision element flow becomes quite complex to debug,  If a combination isnâ€™t added correctly or if the flow breaks due to an error, it 
      may be challenging to track down where the problem occurred.
      III) Error handling cannot be done efficiently on flow, because it has a basic element called FAULT path.
      Iv) One of the biggest challenges encountered was the difference between text and record collections. When passing data between flows 
      or subflows, I needed to pass collections of records (with fields like Type, State, and Number of Contacts), but I initially dealt with text collections that caused limitations in using 
      declarative tools like the data table component. This required additional manipulation, which added complexity.
 2. Created sub-flow for creating/updating the fields Type, State, Contact Count in Contact_Type__c custom object
      <img width="377" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f45042dc-a155-423f-bf95-05cdb3c837b7">
      Issue: Unable to pass the text collection variable to subflow as highlighted above.
3. Data table is created to display data from the contact object, however here we need to pass the output from main flow to subflow, or can add screensflow inside the mainflow,..but the biggest challenge is again the text/record collection variable
   data table always accepts the record collection.
   Biggest drawback: The data table will only display the first 2000 records in the input collection. A collection passed in with more than 2000 records could cause an Apex CPU time limit exceeded error.

     To achieve the above requirement using a declarative tool is possible , but leads to lot of complexity
